# roadmapHomepageMockup

This is a mockup of a website using a roadmap to lead the user visually throught the links. This is primarily done is blacks,grays and whites with the purpose of it being editable. The secondary reasoning being I think it allows for a good contrast.

This page is more CSS extensive than javascript or HTML due to the positioning of each roadsign is done through margining and padding.
